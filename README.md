#Customer Risk Analysis - Churn Dashboard
Task 2:
#Problem Statement:
Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we donâ€™t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end.

Define proper KPIs
Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed.

Solution:
Crafted Power Bi reports including the proper kpi' like Customer at risk, tech tickets, admin tickets ,yearly charges, Monthly charges, demographics, customer account information and service customers signed up for.. 

Crafted two dashboards including Customer Risk Analyis and Churn dashboard and extracted insights from them.
